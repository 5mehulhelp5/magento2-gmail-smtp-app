## Gmail Smtp App for Magento2
Configure Magento to use Google's SMTP server to send all transactional email. 

All you need is either a (i) free Gmail account or (ii) paid Google Apps account..

###Benefits
Since Google's SMTP server does not use Port 25, you'll reduce the probability that an ISP might block your email or flag it as SPAM. Also all your emails sent from Magento will be searchable and backed-up in your email account on Google's servers. 




### Usage
#### Installation
1. Install GmailSmptApp
2. In Magetno Admin goto Store -> System -> Gmail/Google Apps SMPT Pro and enter your email credentials
